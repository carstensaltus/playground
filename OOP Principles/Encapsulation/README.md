Encapsulation
--------------

Encapsulation means that the internal representation of an object is generally hidden from view outside of the object’s definition. Typically, only the object’s own methods can directly inspect or manipulate its fields.

Encapsulation is the hiding of data implementation by restricting access to accessors and mutators.

An accessor is a method that is used to ask an object about itself. In OOP, these are usually in the form of properties, which have a get method, which is an accessor method. However, accessor methods are not restricted to properties and can be any public method that gives information about the state of the object.
